09-02-202422:57:50User: write a javascript if statement
09-02-202422:57:50BOT: Sure, here's an example of a JavaScript if statement:

```
let x = 7;
if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
  console.log("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
```

In this example, if `x` is greater than `5`, the message "x is greater than 5" will be printed to the console. However, if `x` is less than or equal to `5`, the message "x is less than or equal to 5" will be printed instead.
