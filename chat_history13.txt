08/02 22:04:09 User: build me a hello world react component 
08/02 22:04:09 BOT: Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of a Hello World React component:
```
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HelloWorld;
```
You can save this as a `.js` file, import it into your project, and add the component wherever you need it. Let me know if you need more help!
