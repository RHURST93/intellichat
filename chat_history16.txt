08-02-202422:49:52User: code me the fibanucci sequence
08-02-202422:49:52BOT: Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a sample code for generating the Fibonacci sequence:

```
def fibonacci(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
    return sequence

#Call the function and pass the value of n
n = 10
print(fibonacci(n))
```
This code will generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and print them to the console.
